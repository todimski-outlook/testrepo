Hi Funmi,
After a proper evaluation of the scope of work and several engagements with potential partners,
we have concluded that we will not be able to participate in this bid because we or the 
partners we approached to work with have not been able to meet the following key evaluation 
criteria

The firm must possess hands-on and not less than three years’ experience in 
the Providing Managed Security Service Provider Services. 
DO attach PO, award letters or completion certificates as evidences. 

Consultant firm to provide Physical address of their Security operations Centre. 


Information Security certifications for the Company such as 
ISO 27001:2013 as attestation of competence is an added advantage.DO attach copies of certificates


We will however, continue to seek out potential firms we can collaborate with in future as
we anticipate that similar oportunities might surface in the near future.

Many thanks for your kind understanding

Cyber criminals and hacking groups are exploiting the disruption caused by the coronavirus 
through a range of phishing and malware attacks which are likely to proliferate as the outbreak 
intensifies, UK security officials have warned.

Experts from the National Cyber Security Centre, a branch of the signals intelligence agency GCHQ, 
said web users are in danger of losing money and sensitive data if they’re tricked into clicking on 
links in bogus emails claiming to contain important information about the pandemic.

Examples so far include cyber scams by groups impersonating the World Health Organization and the US 
Centre for Disease Control, fraudulent websites advertising antiviral equipment which turns out to 
be fake, and attackers seeking bitcoin funding which they claim is for vaccine research.

COVID-19: Helping You Stay Secure in a Time of Crisis and even Beyond

Cyber criminals and hacking groups are exploiting disruption caused by the 
coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic coronavirus through a range of phishing and malware 
attacks which are likely to increase rapdily as the outbreak intensifies.

Experts warn that web users are in danger of losing money and sensitive data if they’re tricked 
into clicking on links in bogus emails claiming to contain important information about the pandemic.
Examples so far include cyber scams by groups impersonating the World Health Organization and the US 
Centre for Disease Control, fraudulent websites advertising antiviral medicine which turns out to 
be fake and much more. 


It is therefore imperative to stay vigilant against the threat actors during these challenging times 
,because the adversaries are on the move. 
 
Task Systems in collaboration with Secureworks offers the C19 Security Toolkit to help you maintain 
cybersecurity in the face of COVID-19-driven organizational change and keep your business well protected.

Hackers and cyber scammers are taking advantage of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic 
by sending fraudulent emails, links, messages and documents that attempt to trick you into clicking 
on malicious links or opening attachments. These actions can reveal your user name and password, 
which can be used to steal money or sensitive information.

Cyber attacks targeted at the global banking system and high profile institutions are not 
imaginary, but real. The overall objective is to steal financial assets- cash or near-cash assets.

At the 2019 yearly Bankers Committee retreat, in Ogun State, the body, led by the Governor of 
the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, admitted that cyber threat is more real 
than it used to be, but pledged to up their investments in cyber defense this year.

Good evening MD,

We did not abandon this POC and have been working with Xputer. There has been a delay on Xputer's side mainly due to disruption caused by the lockdown.
Belos is a timeline on the project so far

28th Jan - POC initiation and kickoff
1st February - Task sent first draft of our Sales and Procurement Process to Xputer. This was not detailed enough
6th February - Task sent second draft of our Sales and Procurement Process to Xputer. This was accepted and used to begin building the workflows
20th February - Xputer requested for details of all Task staff who would be using the Endear software. This was provided on the same day.
21st February - Xputer continued work on building the workflows.
17th April - The team had several discussions on the POC last week and on how it can help with our BCP plan as well. We then followed up 
on Xputer and now have the below update (forwarded in a separate email). 


"We have been working on it and we are around 70 percent done, the whole implementation should be completed by next week, 
workflow already designed, users and units have also been created we are working on escalation at the moment.
I am working with kelvin in Logistics to get all additional information for us to know the fields that would be added.
I have also reached out to Babatunde with respect to staffs location so in another week everything should be done."

We estimate that we should be able to start testing before the week runs out and have a production platform by the end of next week.

olatunji@riverbedconsulting.com



Dear MD,
I agree with you that we have to hasten the pace of the project. This particular phase of the project is not in our control but we will continue to 
impress a sense of urgency on Xputer.

With respect to everything else we do, we will strive to always strike the right balance between our timelines and the different deliverables
competing for our attention.

the no 1 security threat for organizations today is through their email

https://www.expertinsights.com/insights/what-are-email-security-gateways-how-do-they-work-and-what-can-they-offer-your-organization/

No matter what industry you’re in, protection of sensitive data is a must


I just need my child to maximize his potential. I had registered for this programme before but i honestly did not get any value for it back then. We did not get the kind of personal engagement we hoped for. I sincerely hope there will be a change at this time



but with new improvements in capacity, coverage and performance



The volume of mobile data traffic is expected to grow up to four times in the next few years. Also the number of mobile devices and sensors in the enterprise are anticipated to grow exponentially in the near future. What businesses need to do is to make sure they have a wireless network that can handle this explosion of data and mobile endpoints. This is therefore the perfect time to start planning a wireless network upgrade to Wifi 6.

Wi-Fi 6, also known as 802.11ax, is the latest generation and standard for wireless networks that replaces the 802.11ac, or Wi-Fi 5, standard. 

Multi-user Multiple Input/Multiple Output (MU MIMO)

Oracle EXACC, PULA and ULA



Advantages of Wi-Fi 6
•	Faster data transfer and larger data capacity.
•	Improved power efficiency and longer battery life for mobile end points.
•	Wireless signals can be broken into a greater number of subchannels, decreasing performance issues in crowded places like airports or concert venues.
•	Less interference with other devices, like baby monitors and cordless landline phones.
•	Shorter or eliminated delay times.
•	Fewer dead zones due to expanded beamforming capabilities.
•	Improved connection quality.
•	More seamless mobile roaming.
•	Better at handling advanced applications such as 4K or 8K video.
•	Optimized for IoT use cases with the ability to communicate with multiple IoT protocols, including BLE, Zigbee, and Thread

If there is one lesson businesses have learnt during this pandemic,
it is to speed up their digital tranformation journey......this simply means
that organizations must accelerate the rate at which they modernize their business

for example...modernize applications by using more of native cloud applications and microservices
modernize infrastructure by moving towards a software defined infrasrtructure or software defined WAN
and even modernizing employee worktools and workspace

These are the trends that will become more pervasive from now into the future and the implications are

rise in the need use of mobile computing devices...because as employees are situated everywhere across the 
world, we need to able to work from anywhere....

if staff need to be able to work from anywhere, then there has to be 
a robust hybrid IT platform which can enable them to be productive from wherever they are


in the midst of the current uncertainties, we have opportunists who want to seize the moments
to wreak havoc and comit crime, in this case cybercriminals, so security becomes
even more important



As stated earlier, the new normal is for organisations to empower their workforce to be able to
work from anywhere which basically means giving them mobile worktools. That explains why
there is anticipated rise in the use of mobile computing devices.

However, the reality that businesses have faced in recent times is the slashing of budget
Yet the organisation still expects the technology team to do more with the little budget

Lets take the typical case of referesh of end user computing devices like laptops and desktops
which happens about every 3 to 4 years and which also invloves substantial costs for  

procurement
deployment
training
support 
recovery and 
asset management.

How can the business meet the need to modernize employee worktools with reduced bugdet. This brings us 
to what we call TAAS which is basically a broad model for consuming technology as a service. 
and when we say technology it encompases hardware, software and even services.

Specifically for today we will focus on Device as a Service. So what is DAAS?

Device as a service (DaaS) is the offering of IT hardware, software and services solution as a 
subscription service that is taking typical hardware like laptop, bundling it software and services
and it could custom software and services of which support is also part of services and offering it 
on subscription basis. (usually over a certain contract period which is typically +-3yrs)

So instead of coughing out a huge sum of money in year 1 the organization can spread the 
cost of acquiring and technology over say 3years

GO TO NEXT SLIDE TO EXPLAIN HOW IT WORKS

This is the lifecyle for DAAS. Task systems will make the hardware available, configured and deployed 
with the appropriate image and software...also as part of the package is premier support where we 
proactive monitor the devices for potential problems before they happen for example if a battery is
going to be bad in 1 months time, a replacement is shipped out to the end user, or if a laptop is going
to bad a replacement is shipped out before it happens and so many other scenarios,
then there is also asset recoery such that if a device is missing or stolen, it can be wiped 
and secured remotely


the benefits of DAAS are significant 
The DAAS model helps to make the cost of technology consumption predictable by pushing cost from
apex  to opex
- scale
- reduce ......and frees up IT staff to be concentrate on innovation
- automatic management 

This is a brief about Device as a service . At this point i will hand over to my colleague to who
start the conversation around Oracle Infrastructure.








AMOCN
- uses Oracle ERP
- cisco shop
- netapp storage
- hp laptops and desktop
- uses RSA 2factor authentication 
- sharepoint on premise....looking to move to the cloud

nd organisations are able to
plan IT spending 


ie


Device as a service (DaaS) is the offering of PCs, smartphones and other mobile computing devices as a paid service

Good day,
Thank you for your response. I missed the email because it got delivered into my 
junk mail. 

I had enrolled by 8yr old for one of your programs back in December 2018 (when 
he was 6yr old), and he honestly did not gain much. However, I still believe that
the EIE program is transformational.

Please I'd like to clarify 


1. The program (for a 7yr old and below) will cost
- registration fee		- £100.00
- Class session 1 		- £ 30.00
- Class session 1 		- £ 30.00
.
.
.
.
- Class session N 		- £ 30.00

2. How many classes are there within the program?

3. What are the expectations for the children after the program
- for my 6yr old
- for my 8yr old

4. We are currently in Nigeria for now and they cant seat for the 
GCSE/Early A-Level. What exams will they be prepared for in the Nigerian context?
My 8yrd old (in year 4) will be attempting the Common Entrance in Nigeria, 
later this year

5. Can EIE consider a Nigerian version of this program as many more children
will benefit from this program but the exchange rate will make it extremely
expensive and out of their reach.

“Do not wait: the time will never be just right.  Start where you stand, and work with whatever tools you may have at your command and better tools will be  found as you go along.” - Napoleon Hill

The trick about finding business ideas is that there's always something to sell, and there's always someone to buy. Your job is to find who and what.

People will gladly give you money if you can find out what they want to buy and offer it to them.

Any goal you have that you are LUKEWARM about, you might as well forget about it because you'll never get any result you want without a burning desire.

The very FIRST thing you must do to turn your business into a cash ATM is to become a "student of markets". 

This is the ability to find profitable niches or markets. The ability to find out what people want to BUY.

A father said to his daughter: You graduated with honors, here is a car that I acquired many years ago ... it is several years old.
?????????
But before I give it to you, take it to the used car lot downtown and tell them I want to sell it and see how much they offer you.
?????????
The daughter went to the used car lot, returned to her father and said, "They offered me $1,000 because it looks very worn out." The father said, "Take him to the pawn shop." The daughter went to the pawn shop, returned to her father and said, "The pawn shop offered $100 because it was a very old car." The father asked his daughter to go to a car club and show them the car.
?????????
The daughter took the car to the club, returned and told her father, “Some people in the club offered $100,000 for it since it is a Nissan Skyline R34, an iconic car and sought after by many."
?????????
The father said to his daughter, "I wanted you to know that the right place values ??you the right way." If you are not valued, do not be angry, it means you are in the wrong place. Those who know your value are those who appreciate you. Never stay in a place where no one sees your value.






If you have an idea to create something, please start working on it. Start where you are. Start with confusion and a blank Word Document. Start with fear, start with an overdrawn bank account and no expertise, start with whatever you want. Please just start.

Really not trying to preach today, and I don't know who needs to hear this, but your idea is so much bigger than you. It's not about you or your fears. Nobody cares. Focus on how your idea will serve others - because in most cases it will, and that's what holds you accountable.

Intelligent application traffic management
The brain of the BIG-IP platform, Local Traffic Manager (LTM) intelligently manages network traffic so applications are always fast, available, and secure.




Traditional DDoS solutions focus solely on a narrow range of attacks. Here are some of the reasons they’re only partially effective:
•  By black-holing or rate-limiting, they cripple the connections of legitimate users in network layer (or flood) attacks.

•  They’re blind to SSL traffic and dependent on their placement in the network when application layer attacks hit.

•  On-premises defenses are rendered useless when a WAN bandwidth saturation shuts down Internet connectivity.

Fortunately, DDoS Hybrid Defender provides a greater depth of defense. It’s the only multi-layered defense that protects against blended network attacks and sophisticated application attacks, while enabling full SSL decryption, anti-bot capabilities, and advanced detection methods—all in one appliance. It also delivers the highest performance with line-rate capabilities and without impacting legitimate traffic.






Products Security
DDoS Hybrid Defender
Get comprehensive DDoS protection for your network and at the application layer with flexibility and scale for inline, out-of-band, and hybrid deployments.






Write a letter to Mr Ibrahim telling him 

how you feel  about the online lessons 
1. because it makes it easy for us to study at any time of the day
2. it is very interesting because it has help me to learn how to use the computer well

dont forget to make comparison between the inclass lesson and online lessons
1. the online class is not interactive 
2. during the online class we cannot play with our friends

And also tell him what you want him to do to make the lessons more interesting and fruitful

1. to give us the opportunity to have online classes in real time once in a while instead of recorded videos
2. create a session to ask questions 







I can see the hardware requirement for the software specified is a PC (Intel Core i5-8600 (3100 MHz)) instead of a server, can you confirm this

Axxon support Hikvision, Dahua, Samsung. 
If the unbranded DVR support RTSP, ONVIF, Profile S/T/G or if we can get SDK from the manufacturer, then Axxon can integrate it. 
If the above protocol is not available. Then you will need a small PC with Video capture card on the site. Axxon will integrate the PC to HQ. 
The PC will provide local recording at the site.
If you don’t want local recording at the site, then we can use video encoder to integrate the cameras at the site.
We can help with information where to buy video capture cards or video encoder when you need them.

TABLE 1Questions IT Organizations Should Ask Themselves Prior to Implementing DaaS

1.How do we rate our device strategy today? How effective has itbeen in improving employee productivity, maintaining satisfaction, and supporting overall business operation?

2.How does our device procurement and management process respond to rapid IT technology innovations? Do we think of our lifecycle management of employee devices as best-in-class,or is there room forimprovement?

3.What is our expected turnaround for device repair?Do we have different expectations for different sets of users?

4.How secure are our endpoints? Can we improve endpoint security by workingwith a third-party partner to manage it?

5.What isour typical PC refresh rate?How has the refresh rate changed over time? Is the current refresh rate optimal?

6.How would we benefit from accelerating device refresh cyclesand getting newer devices to users faster?

7.Do we have tiered user personas basedon employee computingneeds? Can we accurately match the right hardware with the right user?

8.Are there critical users (such as engineers)who could immediately benefit fasterdevicerefreshes?

9.How difficult is it financially to refresh a fleet of PCs? Could we benefit financially by moving PC procurement toward an as-a-Service model?

10.Do we have the required budget and resources to support user needs and requirements moving forward?

11.Do we feel our IT organization spendstoo much time and resources on managing our user device lifecycle? What other initiatives can we escalate if we spend less time on managing devices? Could we benefit in offloading these tasks to a third party?

12.Are there imminent opportunities –such as Windows 10 migration –for which we could use a trial of theDaaS model?

13.Is our Windows 10 transition proving problematic from a budgetary and planning perspective? Can DaaS help uskeep up with our Windows 10 transition?

14.What do we do with PCs once they have been decommissioned? Could we benefit from partnering with a provider who can manage asset disposal?Source: IDC, 2017



Questions to Ask When Evaluating a Managed ServiceProvider

1.Please provide an overview of your company (e.g., employee size, annual revenue).

2.What is your history and track record of providing Device as a Service (DaaS) offerings? What specific experience/ examplesof providingDaaSsolutions to companiesin my industry can you cite?

3.Do you have the requisite hardware portfolio to meet the needsof my usersat every level?How do your SLAs support mission-critical workloads? Do the SLAs simply guarantee availability and uptime?Can you adequately manage other vendors'devices and operating systems?

4.What are your service capabilities to ensure our hardware is expertly managed and maintained?What resources and skill sets are available to support my users?Describe your device lifecyclemanagement practices as well as related SLAs to support users in my organization.Does your company have a track record of providing consistent and reliable service across global and local levels in regions where my company has field offices?

5.What is the typical turnaround time for Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA)? How many service centers do you have globally and in my respective locations?

6.Whatare your capabilities in predictive analytics? Can your analytics capabilities help improveservice levels and match the appropriate hardware to the right users?

7.What are your policies around DaaS trials for interested parties?

8.What are your typical terms for fleet refresh as part of the DaaS agreement?What are your typical terms around flexible capacity?

Most businesses continue to rely on static secure email gateways (SEGs) or the baked in security of 
email service providers, such as Office 365 and G-Suite.

However 9 out of 10 cyberattacks still begin with an email phishing attack which means that businesses 
should consider either to replace or supplement their existing solutions with technology that provides multilayered
advanced malware and phishing link detection with the features below

- mailbox-level spoofing and impersonation protection - Prevention technology to work in conjunction with advanced detections to identify sender impersonations, spoofing and business email compromise (BEC).
- human-centric phishing detection - Technical detection alone is not enough, and email phishing is a human and machine problem that requires a combined human and machine solution.
- post-email delivery protection - uses AI and machine learning for automatic phishing detection
- decentralized intelligence - proactively prepare for trending email phishing attacks by leveraging an entire virtual global analyst community

Good day Wilson,
I am interested in getting a refund of my money.

I look forward to hearing from you.







Dear Wilson, 

This another reminder and request for you to pay back what was loaned from me in June 2014.

Despite the fact that your business has thrived (with numerous evidence on social media e.g. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter etc), yet you have refused to refund me. 

In February 2020, I flew from Lagos to Abuja, personally visited you in your Abuja office and you promised to refund me within 1 month. 

How can someone be so callous, wicked and inconsiderate?

For over 6 years now it has all been lies and failed promises.

I hope you will do the right and just thing at this time.

Good night

Good afternoon bros... Please on this Lagos state we basically need your help...i have been under intense pressure from the commissioner himself after meeting with him.... when we return the current modules we will only get a credit of 27,954.20... .looking at the approved discounts the price from TD on the current modules will land at 41,400.00 leaving us with a deficit of 13,445.80... At the moment we are already at a loss on the deal because of FX and adding an extra 13k to that loss will make it worse.... Which is why we need your assistance for extra discount....we need at least 67% from you for TD to match the credit to make this fly I plead that we assist this customer in order to position better for phase 2 of this project Today alone I have received 10 calls from the customer....

customer experience
Why do you often patronize and even recommend a particular business provider?
The reason is because A positive customer experience promotes loyalty, helps you retain 
customers, and encourages brand advocacy. This is why it's so important to provide a 
remarkable experience so that customers are willing to continue doing business with us 
especially when we remember that customers are your best resource for growing our 
brand awareness


process
“if you always do what you always did, you’ll always get what you always got”

If we must get a different result it means we have to do something different. Thats
why processes are important. Business process describes how things are done and gives us
the opportunity to keep improving on/tweaking them in order to get different and better 
outcomes.

we want our process to be simple, fast and efficient.

================
our goal is to ensure that we keep keep improving on/tweaking our process in order to 
make it simpler, faster and more efficient 



sustaniability 
sustainability is a business approach to creating long-term relevance.

This is simply ensuring that we identify and move with the industry / technology trends

Dear Sandipa,
Many thanks for your patience and understanding with respect to this matter.

Besides the circumstances occasioned by the pandemic that led us to shut down
our offices and go on an extended isolation period, it has also taken this long 
to respond and provide feedback on your inquiry because the account executive who 
handled this transaction had left the organization for over 1 year, had wiped
out his emails and work profile at his exit and this had made it difficult to find 
relevant information in response to the enquiry.

However, in order to ensure we provide a feedback to you and after several follow ups
with the previous AM, the attached email trail 
was shared, which we want to believe 
highlights conversations around the transaction. 

From the trail, it appeared that there was an ongoing conversation with the customer 
while the AM was expecting a formal PO to close. Unfortunately, the deal was cancelled
and it seemed none of the intended products or equipment were received 
by Task Systems as there are no records showing delivery of the items.

Once again we thank you for your patience and understanding.

Dear Sandipa,
Sincere apologies for the delays and very many 
thanks for your patience and understanding 
with respect to this matter.Please note that the 
delays experienced have not been intentional in 
any way.

Besides the circumstances occasioned by the 
pandemic that led us to shut down our offices and 
go on an extended isolation period, it has also 
taken this long to respond and provide feedback on 
your inquiry because the account executive who 
handled this transaction had left the organization 
for over 1 year, had wiped out his emails and work 
profile at his exit and this had made it difficult 
to find relevant information in response to the 
enquiry, moreso as none of the people copied in 
this email were in the loop of the conversations 
that have any semblance to this transaction.  

However, in order to ensure we provide a feedback 
to you and after several follow ups with the 
previous AM, we have had to do extensive and 
detailed checks of our records, the attached 
trail conversations, which we want to believe 
highlights conversations around the transaction,
while we have not been able to find any other
information in relation to requested documents.

 
From the trail, it appeared that there was an 
ongoing conversation (pipeline review between the 
customer, AM and the then Cisco AM, with perhaps a 
deal registration as it is typically the case)
where it was decided to place this 
order ahead of customers internal processes and 
approvals and for which the AM was expecting a 
formal PO to in order to properly close the deal .

Unfortunately, as shown in the trail, the deal 
was cancelled and it seemed none of the intended 
products or equipment were received by Task Systems
as there are no records showing delivery of the 
items.

 
Once again sincere apologies for the delay and 
thank you for your patience and understanding.

hi@flutterwavego.com

Your ticket ID is 140582201547029. 



[15/07, 04:32] +234 816 124 1650: This is an exercise.for the house. *PLEASE EVERY ONE SHOULD ATTEMPT IT*

*Briefing*
Every department has an admin that  relates to 
tee head of admins (super admin)

Using your career background: 
Sales, Network, Business analyst, 
cyber security etc
- Design an admin group (example: cyber security dpt) 
assign roles to a team of 5 team members. 

Give permission to the resources you feel they should have 
permission to use on your company's AWS cloud.

- List permission : This only allow user to view resources but 
can now use it, executes, edited creat nor delete

-Read permission: it means user can execute, copy or use this 
resources but they cannot edit, move, delete or creat it.

Write permission: this means user can creat, delete, read, copy, 
move, and edit the resources.

Permission granting : this meade this person can serve as admin. 
The user has right to give permission to another user.

With this expo I believe your work is made easier.

We will review it on Saturday pre- Lab session.

I trust you guys.

Ps. These are question relating to certification and job role 
interviews.

Don't forget our best student in the session that participate 
and commit him/herself to this first  three months session  
will be given free Certification voucher.

Thanks

*Pilot*
[15/07, 04:43] +234 816 124 1650: Another expo
- you will be designing two groups one for admin and one 
for team members.

Research on the type of resources in AWS that the team group 
should use like sales dpt will use Chime, network will use ROUT 53, and etc

That's all .

All the best .

Restrict some user to some resources usage with permission.

And test the user if the permission was properly given.

With application-aware technology that can detect anomalies, Neverfail will instantly failover systems to a secondary (or tertiary) site when an downtime event is detected. Limit recovery times to near-zero and prevent downtime altogether.

Go Beyond HA & Experience
True Continuous Availability
Most availability software will simply replicate data, but to provide continuous availability you have to protect the entire ecosystem, including: data, operating systems, applications, networks and user connectivity. Neverfail's Continuity Engine goes beyond replication with application-aware technology that proactively monitors the health and configuration of applications. If a failure event is detected, Continuity Engine will failover the server to the standby host before there is any impact to the user. When you’re ready to failback to production, it’s a simple push of a button. It’s time to go beyond HA and turn replication into true continuous availability.

Microsoft is going.

We look forward to your feedback and suggestions.




 that 






Yes it will work.
Next step is remote access(AnyDesk or TeamViewer with unattended access setup for easy access during configuration time).
We also need to reach NVR or camera IP from the backup server(the server to install VMS)

Unlike backup infrastructure or a complete backup site, the Dell EMC Power Protect Cyber Recovery vault is a solution specifically focused on protecting essential data and its recovery in case of cyber-attack.

 

The most business-critical data sets and system configuration data are identified in advance.
This critical data is isolated in an electronic vault outside of the rest of the network, with no external IP link to the vault.
Automated software policies are used to encrypt and synchronize data once a day through replication, breaking the link between each sequence (air gap).
The backup software target manages replication as well as a continuous security and integrity analysis of idle data.
The data stored externally in the vault is encrypted and managed through distinct access accounts for authorized officers designated by the company.
Golden image copies are also kept for main business systems and executable source codes of applications considered the most critical in order to speed up recovery.
 


Cybercrime, ransomware, hacking – these scenarios are a regular occurrence for organizations of every size. On average, a cyberattack occurs every 39 seconds, according to research from University of Maryland. And cyberattacks are becoming more frequent.

Regardless of your size, your company and customer data are attractive and profitable targets for cybercriminals. With a cyber recovery strategy in place before the crime occurs, you can ensure the safety and future success of your organization.

Our experts can help your enterprise leverage a Dell EMC cyber recovery solution to reduce the risk of getting attacked while simultaneously creating a more intelligent data protection strategy.

it's no longer news that I love books

everyone who follows this channel knows

that by now what many may not know is

that biographies are by far my favorite

books and this is because reading the

stories of how some of the most

successful people in the world achieved

what they achieved is by far the best

way to get inspiration that can propel

you to achieve greatness in life in

today's video I'll be sharing with you

the top 10 lessons I learned from

reading biographies of some of the most

successful people in the world if you're

new here consider subscribing so you
00:37
won't miss other exciting videos like
00:40
this one the goal posts make soccer
00:44
matches interesting about 12 years ago
00:47
when I announced to my family that I was
00:49
not going to continue with schooling my
00:51
elder brother invited me to his house
00:53
and asked me an unexpected question okay
00:57
what do you want to do with your life my
01:01
answer was straightforward I want to
01:04
build a company and teach Africans how
01:06
to do the same that simple answer is
01:09
what my entire life has concentrated on
01:12
over the last 12 years the second great
01:16
lesson I've learned from studying the
01:18
lives of the most successful people is
01:20
that every single individual who
01:22
achieved great success were not in doubt
01:25
regarding where they were going in life
01:27
as a little boy Steve Jobs was asked by
01:31
his angry parents what do you want to do
01:34
with your life the 15 year old Jobs
01:37
answered I want to compete with IBM
01:40
that's what Steve did with his entire
01:42
life
01:43
can you define your life in a single
01:46
sentence do you in specific terms know
01:49
precisely where your life is heading
01:52
just imagine a soccer match without goal
01:55
posts what are the players aiming at and
01:57
how can such a match be interesting if
02:00
your life doesn't have specific goal
02:03
posts your life will be boring and will
02:05
end nowhere two geniuses aren't that
02:09
smart I have seen this again and a
02:13
from my personal life and studying the
02:15
lives of the most successful people in
02:17
the world geniuses are not as smart as
02:21
most people assume after reading
02:23
biographies and stories of tens of
02:26
successful people and seeing how I
02:28
achieved everything I've achieved in
02:30
life I can confidently tell you that
02:33
most people who become great successes
02:36
are not extraordinary and you don't have
02:39
to be extraordinary either this is what
02:42
happens most successful people simply
02:45
hang in there there's no complex formula
02:48
to achieving success in life it's mostly
02:51
about hanging in there
02:52
do you want to build a successful
02:54
company all you have to do is to be
02:57
willing to start and never look back
03:00
do you want to be a successful scientist
03:02
all you have to do is to have a sleeping
03:05
mat in the laboratory it's simple but
03:09
not easy just hang in there and never
03:11
look back
03:12
your luck will come and you'll become
03:15
successful 3 success requires arrogance
03:19
I came from an impoverished uu family
03:22
and grew up in a village where nobody
03:25
ever made $10,000 a year so when I told
03:28
people I wanted to build a successful
03:30
company and make millions they believed
03:34
that I was arrogant and to be honest
03:36
with you I was after studying the lives
03:39
of most successful people I can tell you
03:41
that arrogance is one of the ingredients
03:44
of success because if you're not
03:46
arrogant
03:47
you wouldn't think you can do the
03:49
impossible most things are often called
03:51
impossible until they are done flying in
03:54
the sky was believed to be impossible
03:56
it took some crazy arrogant men to
03:59
believe they could figure it out
04:01
transmitting human voice or images from
04:04
one location to another was also found
04:07
to be impossible the guys who dared to
04:10
figure it out were arrogant or else they
04:12
wouldn't try often when you look at your
04:15
life circumstances you'll see that what
04:18
you want to achieve is impossible and
04:20
that's the reason you need some dose of
04:23
arrogance to believe that you can do the
04:25
impossible
04:26
for life starts when you know what you
04:30
can die for Martin Luther King jr. was a
04:33
coward boy or let's call him a shy boy
04:36
to give him some honor he didn't like to
04:39
be what he ended up becoming many times
04:42
he rejected the possibility of him
04:44
leading the civil rights movement until
04:47
the day he became convinced he was born
04:49
for the purpose of that movement Mark
04:52
Twain said the two most important days
04:55
in your life are the day you are born
04:57
and the day you find out why great
05:00
people in the past people like Napoleon
05:03
Bonaparte often made themselves believed
05:05
they were descendents of Gaunt's or
05:07
something like that
05:09
this belief made them arrogant and gave
05:11
them faith in themselves you don't have
05:14
to go to such extremes but you have to
05:17
figure out your reason for existence
05:19
because if you don't your life would be
05:21
boring after Martin Luther King jr. was
05:24
convinced that his life's purpose was to
05:26
fight for african-american rights death
05:29
or difficulties no longer have the power
05:32
to stop him similar things happen to
05:35
most people who succeed in life they
05:37
just get to a point where their goal
05:39
seems more important than their lives
05:42
five seek to know what no one does
05:46
char's team Unger said in my whole life
05:50
I have known no wise people who didn't
05:53
read all the time none zero manga is a
05:57
billionaire entrepreneur and if you
06:00
don't take his words seriously you won't
06:03
take mine so let me repeat what he said
06:06
in my whole life I have known no wise
06:10
people who didn't read all the time none
06:14
zero six you must get used to falling
06:19
the right words for success is failure
06:21
outcome because success is nothing but
06:25
the outcome of massive failures I have
06:28
studied the lies of the most successful
06:31
people in the world and I can tell you
06:33
something they failed more than they
06:36
succeeded I'm 33 at the time of making
06:39
this
06:40
and I can tell you that only a few 33
06:43
year olds have gone through half of the
06:46
difficulties that I've been through in
06:48
my life and that's probably the reason
06:51
why only a few people of my age have the
06:54
kind of success that I have you have to
06:57
get used to trying new things this will
07:00
often mean you'll make mistakes and
07:01
sometimes fail but as long as you keep
07:04
on trying you win seven just try John F
07:10
Kennedy said a single person can make
07:13
the difference and all of us should try
07:16
people who become successful don't
07:19
necessarily have the assurance that they
07:21
will become successful yes I said
07:24
earlier that these people believe in
07:26
themselves don't also forget that I said
07:29
that they are often arrogant while I
07:32
believed strongly that I would build a
07:33
company of my own when I started nearly
07:36
twelve years ago I had no certainty and
07:39
nobody ever had any certainty the
07:42
difference between those who achieve
07:44
greatness and the rest of the world is
07:46
that successful people just try and keep
07:50
on trying they understand that the risk
07:53
and dangers they know they could have
07:55
crashed and destroyed their lives yet
07:57
they decided to try eight think like
08:02
Messiah there are two kinds of people in
08:05
the world those who think they are
08:07
victims and those who think they aren't
08:10
messiahs most people I know think like
08:13
victims they think life happens to them
08:16
they think they have zero control they
08:19
think they are just one irrelevant
08:21
powerless object in the changing world
08:25
successful people think the opposite of
08:27
this they think they are the Messiah
08:30
they think they are capable of solving
08:32
some of the world's problems they think
08:35
they can influence the world and make
08:37
change happen
08:39
ix learn to use people
08:43
okay I simply wanted to say learn to
08:46
live and work with people almost every
08:49
successful person I studied knows how to
08:52
get what they want from other humans
08:54
this is very important because you won't
08:57
go far except other humans like you and
09:00
are willing to make sacrifices for you
09:03
10 stop looking for a success formula
09:06
the other day I talked about Albert
09:09
Einstein and Elon Musk and right there

in the comment section someone pointed

out a significant mindset of Einstein

which is directly opposite of what musk

believes well there's no specific

formula for greatness there are only

lessons and that's what this video is

all about if you compare the lives of

Bill Gates to that of Steve Jobs you'll

see some extreme opposites even though

they are both successful entrepreneurs

if you compare the lives of Winston

Churchill to that of Abraham Lincoln

you'll notice some contradictions even

though there are both successful

politicians there is more than one road

that leads to the market and knowing

this will make you choose what you learn

from individuals these are the summary

of what I've shared with you so far goal

posts are what make a soccer match

interesting if your life doesn't have

specific goals it will be boring

geniuses aren't that smart they just

keep on trying success requires some

arrogance you have to believe that you

can do the impossible life starts when

you know what you can die for you must

know why you're living to be able to

remain dedicated to your life's goals

get used to failing it's inevitable seek

to know what no one does learn always

just try even if you fail think like a

messiah don't think like a victim learn

to use people you must know how to make

other people want to help you stop

looking for a specific formula to

success just learn

we love you


stop doing dumb things
start doing smart things
modernize the smart things

With respect to your query concerning the relationship between Mr LeoStan Ekeh 
and Mrs Chioma Ekeh in connecion to Zinox technologies, please note that Mr Ekeh 
is the founder of Zinox technologies and remains a shareholder and director of Zinox 
Technologies. Zinox was the pioneer company to go into the uncharted terrain of Computer 
production and ICT solutions in SubSahara Africa including being the first internationally
certified indigenous computer brand in SubSahara Africa among other notable firsts.

As mentioned in my previous email, Mr. Ekeh's passion in recent times has radically 
shifted to e-commerce which he pioneered in Africa some years back, with the acquisition 
of Konga Online Shopping Limited by his company, Zinox Technologies Limited. In addition,
to pursuing his interests in e-commerce, Mr Ekeh is also focused on investments in the 
growing African Fintech space.

Conversely, Chioma Ekeh has no business relationship with Zinox Technologies Limited, as she is neither a director nor a shareholder of the company. She has never had any contract or relationship  with Zinox.

Ill like to respond to a conversation around ngc from the last meeting
with respect to skills and pricing and margins

if we check our pnl on both projects, we will see that we have nothing less than 30% margin on 
skills related pricing sometimes 60% margin. where we had challenges with reduced margin
was the effect of FX on the product cost. product cost with respect delayed order processing was 
what reduced the margin not the cost of deloyment or other services related costs. 

This is the same for most services related pricing that I have always been involved in

on the theme...my thoughts are around our pillars
everything we talked about are somehow in our pillars but we do not live by our pillars

so my thoughts are that it is time to live by those principles

so my suggestion to the pool of ideas is .....Living by our Pillars

HP TechPulse helps you centralize device management in a single platform that provides unprecedented visibility to endpoint health.  Our cloud integration makes it easy for you to manage employee devices in and out of the office.


With HP Proactive Insights,
IT knows what’s coming.

HP Proactive Insights/Active care helps you centralize device management in a single platform 
that provides unprecedented visibility to endpoint health.  

Using artificial intelligence (AI) technology and predictive analytics, IT is able to detect 
and predict when a machine or a device, including a computer,is going to have a problem and take steps 
to fix it before the issue actually manifests in a breakdown – and a loss of user productivity.

“If we can predict a failure, IT doesn’t have to take as many calls from users. It’s 
a nice way to reduce costs.”


Through the HP Proactive Insights service, the company monitors key hardware characteristics, 
including thermal issues and hardware and software errors. It can also diagnose performance issues, 
such as when one customer saw a spike in users suffering the dreaded “blue screen of death.”

“That can be challenging to diagnose in a small device population,” Paetzel says. “Because we have 
a large data pool to analyze against, we can see if a certain pattern is happening beyond one 
customer.”

Sure enough, it found two drivers that were causing the issue and advised the company to change 
them. Once it did, the spikes went down.

Predicting failures, automating responses

Using analytics, HP can also predict when a component such as a battery or hard drive is in danger 
of failing. Laptop batteries have been a particular issue during the pandemic because they are 
designed to be continually charged and discharged. But users working from home tend to have them 
docked and charging all the time.

“We can detect when a battery is under continuous charge and not being conditioned properly,” Paetzel 
says. In some instances, HP may detect users don’t have certain settings turned on, such as HP Health 
Manager and important security settings. It can also detect if a machine’s BIOS is out of date, which 
can lead to security issues.

When it does find an issue, HP Proactive Insights can automatically kick off routines to get the 
problem addressed.

“We can display whether the device is under warranty,” Paetzel says. “If so, we can trigger a 
response based on the entitlement of that service.”

For large organizations, HP Proactive Insights can tie in with their IT service management (ITSM) 
tool to automate a response. The same goes for customers that subscribe to other HP services, such 
as HP Active Care for next-day response to problems.

What is an industry leader?
An industry leader is an organization or single professional within a particular industry that is considered the most effective and impactful in that industry. Companies typically become industry leaders when they are the most recognizable among their competitors and have high sales numbers. Individuals typically become industry leaders when they lead an organization to market recognition and high sales as well as become known as an expert in business or that industry.

Characteristics of industry leaders
These are some of the characteristics of industry-leading companies and individuals:

Effective strategic planning and management
High sales
Loyal customers, client base or audience
Talented and satisfied employees

Elon musk's father owned an emrald mine in apartheid South Africa-MONEY

Jeff Bezos started Amazon with 300,000 dollars that he got from his parents and from his rich friends-MONEY

Bill Gate's mum sat on thesame board as the CEO of IBM and convinced him to take a risk on her son's new company- Connection.

Mark Zukerbeg was attending one of the best universities in the world, Harvard. he dropped out to focus on Facebook and he was given the opportunity to showcase what he had- working system

Warren Buffett is the son of a powerful congressman who owned an investment company-family background.

The fact is, it's harder for a person who has no connection, no money, no family support, or a working system to make it than a person who has one or even all of these.

Even Dangote isn't from a poor home. His grandfather, Dantata was once one of the richest men in Nigeria- Foundation.

My point exactly is, the only thing you have is education, why exactly are you motivating yourself with "most of the world richest men are school dropouts"?

Firstly, only 0.7 percent of world richest people are dropouts but have you even considered what the system is like and what they drop out for?

Mark Zukerbeg dropped out becuase he had built facebook, he had been given a platform to showcase it and he needed to concentrate.
He didn't drop out because of carryovers or bad behaviours, or no school fees, etc.

They dropped out to focus. They were one of the brightest in their various classes. You are using basket to pack numerous carryovers every semester in uniben, and you want to motivate yourself with the story of brilliant people who dropped out of Harvard, really?

See, the only thing you have is education. Why not try as much as you can to make the best of it?
Education is very important, it's no scam. You don't just get education from schooling. You connects witg people, make friends and you are even more opened to opportunities while in school. Why are you like this?

Focus, my dear.
You have no connection,
You have no money,
You have no family support,
You have no working system,
But, the only thing you have is education and you are taking it for granted?
Really?

Think about it.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/reserved-capacity-overview?view=azuresql

Save money with Azure SQL Database and SQL Managed Instance by committing to a reservation for 
compute resources compared to pay-as-you-go prices. With reserved capacity, you make a 
commitment for SQL Database and/or SQL Managed Instance use for a period of one or three 
years to get a significant discount on the compute costs. To purchase reserved capacity, 
you need to specify the Azure region, deployment type, performance tier, and term.

At the end of the reservation term, the billing benefit expires and the database or managed
 instance is billed at the pay-as-you go price. Reservations do not automatically renew


Your SQL Database reserved capacity – SQLDB_RI_05-31-2021_15-26 is expiring on May 31, 2022. 
To continue receiving reservation discounts when the current term expires, 
please set up renewal before May 31, 2022 to automatically renew your reservation.

Dear Sidi,
What the below means is that you have SQL Database reserved capacity 
(named SQLDB_RI_05-31-2021_15-26) which has been running for the last 1 year and 
this reservation will be expring on May 31, 2022.

Now the challenge with SQL Database reserved capacity  is that reservations do not automatically 
renew, which means that you have to extend the period of reservation manually.
Hence the email below requesting that you set up renewal (for another 1 year or 3 years) 
before this one expires so that you can continue receiving reservation discounts into the 
new term beyond May 31, 2022.

If for any reason this reservation term ends, the billing benefit that comes with reserved capacity
expires and the database or managed instance will be billed at the pay-as-you go price which will

Microsoft 365 was first released, the provisioning of the SKU in your tenant would happen at the component level – i.e., you’d see Windows E3, Office 365 E3, and Enterprise Mobility and Security E3 as separate services

original and unified m365 skus
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/licensing/news/microsoft365-licensing-update

M365 E3 Original Sub Per User 


When Microsoft 365 was first released, the provisioning of the SKU in your tenant would happen at the component level – i.e., you’d see Windows E3, Office 365 E3, and Enterprise Mobility and Security E3 as separate services. This is known as the M365 E3 Original SKU. As we continued to invest and transform the product, we were able to create a SKU that would provision into the tenant as one service containing all components – i.e., you would see M365 E3/E5 depending on what you bought, giving you the ability to assign a single license for all features to each licensed user. This is known as the M365 Unified SKU. 
 
As you can see from your licence summary below, you have M365 E3 Original – which will provision as 3 components, and M365 E5 Unified – which will provision as one single service. NOTE: This does not mean that you can license different users with individual components; you must license a single user with all 3 components - Windows, Office, EMS. 

Transitioning from M365 Original to M365 Unified
https://www.microsoftpartnercommunity.com/t5/Commercial-Solutions-Updates/Transitioning-from-M365-Original-to-M365-Unified/td-p/40817


It is recommended that existing customers remain on the Original SKUs unless they are willing to accept the administrative overhead of manually unassigning the Original SKUs and assigning the Unified SKUs. 

M365 F3 FUSL Sub Per User



Dear Nneka,
Trust that work is going on well.

The below licenses were ordered and provisioned 

M365 E3 Original Sub Per User.
M365 F3 FUSL Sub Per User


When Microsoft 365 was first released, it was released as M365 E3 Original. This SKU is usually provisioned as 3 different components– i.e., you’d see Office 365 E3, Windows E3, and Enterprise Mobility and Security E3 as separate services.

However, a new SKU was created to provide all the component services as one service. This is the M365 Unified SKU.

I spent 4,000$ on a Cloud computing bootcamp, so you don't have to.

Yup, you read that correctly. I spent 4Gs on a bootcamp designed to help me become a cloud engineer through self study.

Here's honestly how I feel about it:

I would only do it again because of the people I met and the relationships I've formed...

Otherwise, the courses were extremely dry, the production value was abhorrent and I legitimately fell asleep during them.

The curriculum was as followed:
A+/Network+/Cloud+
Intro to AWS/Azure
Intro to Linux
Intro to Python.

It's quite the shame looking back on it, because there are free/dirt cheap courses that are SIGNIFICANTLY more well produced and will help you so much more to achieve your goals to become a cloud engineer.

Here's a list of resources I'd recommend over ANY bootcamp, way higher quality and value for the knowledge/experience you'd get through them:

Python:
solid beginner lessons to learn python. Nana Janashia
https://lnkd.in/gnmCUPYP

https://lnkd.in/ghxRzni3

an extraordinary amount of projects in order to learn python and various frameworks/tools.
https://lnkd.in/g-VAHp_t

Linux:
Amazing course on Linux Administration
https://lnkd.in/gBvWKHij

Great course for learning BASH scripting.
https://lnkd.in/gwdHpedw

DevOps tooling:
https://lnkd.in/gATw2Kau
https://lnkd.in/gH6uS4kS

AWS:
Hands down the best AWS courses on the market Adrian Cantrill
Tons of hands-on projects to put on a resume.
https://lnkd.in/gN7MDyTE

Practice tests by Jon Bonso @ Tutorials Dojo
https://lnkd.in/gZ3cvP-S

At the end of the day, The internet is an amazing resource and you can (probably) learn much more through your own studies vs. paying someone for a degree/bootcamp

I am happy to provide funding to my son for the full tuition fees, accommodation and daily expenditure while studying in Canada. My desire to fund his studies comes from his passion and consistent desire to grow in his chosen field of study and how he has used this to solve challenges at his place of work and how I also believe he will impact the society once he is able to complete his studies. 
The funds come from my extended and steady income /deposits from my business and tenancy agreements from properties I currently own. I have attached certificate of incorporation and documents of the properties to backup this claim.
I can confirm my ability to fund the total amount (30,000.00 CAD) required for his studies without any difficulties and attached as part of his application is an evidence of my bank statements plus my statement of net worth which totals to approximately (224,919.49 CAD). I give my consent to the funds being available to my son for study in CANADA.

Your Kind consideration of his application is greatly appreciated. Thank You.


This letter is to verify that I, Oluwatodimu Olatunji Adebajo,
am willing and capable of financially supporting myself during the time
I will be studying at Memorial University. I have provided
personal financial documentation to show that I have sufficient funds
to pay a minimum of ....for the program.

If you have any questions or concerns about this matter,
Please feel free to contact me at toldimsky@yahoo.com

EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization








Wilson Unachukwu, you have been owing me for 8 years. Be a honourable man and please pay me what you borrowed from me 8 years ago. I hope to hear from you





Hi Chioma,
I want to start from Slide 5 the old school balance sheet

1. Cash and cash equivalents are the monies in the bank right?
If yes can I have the breakdown or where can I get it

2. Trade and other receivables - these is debt owed us right/
can you share the breakdown

3. what constitutes inventory of over 4m

4. Property, Plant & Equipment - how is that arrived at?

5. 
Deferred Tax Asset
Investmnet in TdPlus Ltd - expecting this amount from TDPlus?
Due from Group Chairman - - expecting this amount from Chairman?
Due from Related Company - - expecting this amount from Related Company? Who are these company?
loan and Receivables - - from where?
Prepayment - from who?


6. Trade and other payables - payment to our creditors, right?
Current tax liabilities - okay
Deferred tax liabilities - okay
Borrowings - from who
Other liabilities - can you please share the breakdown of this?


Slide 7
top 5 debtor-- top 5 customers owing us

the numbers are in naira and I want to believe that since they
were transacted at different times we converted using diff fx rates
hence why they are in naira

Slide 8
same reason we have this slide in naira, right?

slide 9
i will get the team to try to reconfirm the commits

- we do not have mtn here. i guess we can put it right?

- should we even include the slide?


Slide 6

1. what is our total debt ?
total debt = old debt + fy22 debt + fy23debt right?

what is fy22 debt 
how much of fy22 debt have we collected?
ie
fy22 debt =  usd4m
fy22 collections = usd1m

what is fy23
how much of fy23 debt have we collected?
ie
fy23 debt =  usd5m
fy23 collections = usd2m

we may have to talk about slide 6

Please see below my thoughts with respect to this invitation to the job fair.

At the moment if we need to employ a resource for the Huawei business, it has to be a knowledgeable resource that can practically chase opportunities without too much supervision but of course with support. Bringing on interns and trainees will not help us achieve the momentum we may need with the advanced offerings that Huawei is looking to push at the moment. We may discuss this with Gary based on their offer when I and Eky met them.

If we must attend, can Ijeoma go from Lagos while Funmi joins her? We may then put the resource(s) in the Abuja office. Flight and other costs will be borne by Huawei.

Chioma,
 
I need to chat with these guys virtually and 

I also need to know their respective  targets before they are employed and that 
shall be the basis for confirmation.
 
Finally, you cannot recruit the chap from N200k to over N345k that 
we do not know his competence. N300k is enough and then you challenge him 
that if he performs, he will be confirmed on that figure. 

You should also know how many of their customers they are bringing from first 
4 months of resumption to test their capacity. 


This is the trend.

1.	SUPPLY OF 100 USERS M365 E3 FOR NCX FOR 1YEAR UNDER CBN TENANCY
Helen generated 12months, but Bola got 14 months when she printed invoice. The invoice is printed based on the number of months left in the EA. CBN is not ready to pay for additional 2 months. So, is it possible to generate just 12 months as requested by CBN, not based on EA. 

It is not possible to generate just 12 months as requested by CBN. What is generated is based on the EA and if any pricing is generated now it will be less than 12 months since the EA will expire in less than 12 months. We already had this conversation. Yes, you’re correct.

          When did CBN give us PO and when was order booked on their behalf? This is what we need to show CBN. I take responsibility here. Helen actually quoted for 16 months, but I quoted for 12 months, since CBN requested for 12 months and not aware that quotes are generated based on no. of months in the EA. I just got to know this. I have made a justification for this to Nneka and she forwarded my mail to Madam Wakilat. I want us to resolve all pending issues, so that I can speak to Madam Wakilat with boldness. Would appreciate your support here sir, by talking to  Madam Wakilat because it’s a license they will surely consume.
What in particular do you want me to tell her?


2.	RENEWAL OF MS EA & NAMBUIT
We need to urgently renew the last year of EA & NAMBUIT which the Azure is on overage and they are not happy about the overages. When we renew, it clears off the overages on the portal. We promised to renew this week during our teams meeting last week and I received a follow-up call from CBN last Friday.

We discussed this last week and I explained that it seems that our credit hold with Microsoft must be the reason why CBN’s Azure credit was not allocated. If the credit is allocated, the overage they have on the account will be deducted from the Year 3 Azure prepayment. That’s our internal issue Boss T and you promised in the meeting that we would get it done this week. I would appreciate if we resolve all credit issues asap and confirm to CBN by Friday that we have renewed.
Tunji, just thinking about this again and the renewal of an ongoing contract is automatic and should not be affected by credit hold. Credit hold only affects you when you want to book a new order.

          Funmi, let them know we are discussing this with Microsoft and their overages will clear soon. As long as it doesn’t stop them from working, they shouldn’t worry about it. Okay Sir.


3.	ADDITIONAL MS LICENSES
	- this case was logged last week and has been resolved. Kindly get the customer
to send us an email confirming that it is resolved

	- concerning the Teams license replacement, MSFT is insisting we must pay for the previous license
before the new licenses can be provisioned even when our credit manager has approved the change.
Please speak and escalate to Adeola to help with this internally.

            Tunji, on the M365 issue, who is to log the case? I am assuming it is your team that should log this case. Can you get it done today?
          On the Teams license issue, what will be the cost impact of cancelling the wrong license and logging the correct one?

4.	AZURE APP SERVICES 
	- This is still pending with MSFT
	- Concerning the Azure prepayment credits, MSFT has not provisioned the credits and we have also not been invoiced

The 3 types of projects are categorized into 3 levels and remember that the main reason you are going to build these projects is to move up from low complexity to higher complexity so that you get comfortable with typing code easily.

LEVEL 1 = These projects are simple/basic (not easy but simple/basic) and they will teach you about the Syntax, you will apply concepts, and use control flow statements and u will most importantly learn how to problem solve.  You should build about 4 to 8 projects with using the bare minimum just to make them work.
Their rules of thumb are:
That they do less than 5 things
Usually less than 200 lines of code 
they do not rely on libraries or frameworks to build
Examples:  
Static website
Personal Website
Website for Local Business (Real or Create a Fake Business)
Digital Clock
Todo App
Expense Tracker
Vowel Counter
Pig Latin Generator
Weight Tracker App
Recipes App
Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
Note Taking App

LEVEL 2 = These projects are intermediate level projects.You should build about minimum 3 but if u find that it is easy for u to build these projects than build up to 6.
Their rules of thumb are:
They do more than 5 things 
Usually less than 500 lines of code 
Use of libraries or frameworks at a minimal because u still would want to use the fundamentals and handling all the complexity. 

Examples:
Space Invaders Game
Snake Game
Tetris Game
Pong Game
Calculator
Web Scraper
Flash Card App
Address Book (Contact Manager)

LEVEL 3 =  These projects are Capstone Level projects (High/Expert level projects) and you should build about 1 to 3 projects (2 being the sweet spot).
Their rule of thumb are:
They usually do 10 or more things
They use integrations 
They use multiple libraries or frameworks 
They use more than 500 lines of code
They should be interesting 
Examples:
Facebook Clone
Twitter Clone
LinkedIn Clone
Instagram Clone
Online Forum
"Fake" E-Commerce Store
Crypto Tracker
Airline/Hotel Reservation System

So, the total pricing for CBN will therefore be

Currently, I work as a Project Manager at Itsync Synergy Limited. 

In my role, I successfully lead the implementation and deployment of Software applications, 
ERP, HR, and Payroll Software solutions for various companies in different sectors.

 

I can bring to the company my wealth of experience as a PMI member, IIBA member, certified PMP and 
Business Analyst in developing successful project plans, communicating 
expectations clearly, and encouraging team enthusiasm, even in the late stages of the project cycle




My opinion is drawn from how we give service we give to our customers.

Our customer, Bank A for instance, procures computing devices and instead of 
employing an entire supply chain team they choose to have a procurement liaison (within their
procurement team) and then outsource the entire procurement operations (ordering, OEM engagement, shipping, 
local logistics and last mile delivery) to us. To the customer, our service is a black box 
(invisible to them and independent to us). As much as possibe, this is the model that 
an as-a-service offering should follow.


CREDIT AND COLLECTIONS	
- to be done using Task identity though we risk giving away our customer database 

PROCUREMENT, LAST MILE, LOGISTICS, WAREHOUSE
Task to have a liason function that interfaces with TD

In providing us this service, should there be access to our profitability or other working documents?

FINANCE, FINANCE OPERATIONS
- to be done using Task identity

AUDIT 

- Perhaps a dedicated resource seconded from the group Audit team

OR

- A resource within the group Audit team will be focused on Task

Whichever approach from the options above is workable


REBATE	- this external person/team coordinates with relevant Task resource(s)						17
					
MARKETING - this external person/team coordinates with relevant Task resource(s), Sales and Tech Team
						
MIS - this is existing
						
DATA SCIENCE - this external person/team coordinates with relevant Task resource(s)					26
	






Project
- infra
- modern work


ticketing

tam assignment

git
First Time Git Configuration
Before you can start using Git, you need to configure it. Run each of the following lines on the command line to make sure everything is set up.

# sets up Git with your name
git config --global user.name "<Your-Full-Name>"

# sets up Git with your email
git config --global user.email "<your-email-address>"

# makes sure that Git output is colored
git config --global color.ui auto

# displays the original state in a conflict
git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3

git config --list


Git & Code Editor
The last step of configuration is to get Git working with your code editor. Below are three of the most popular code editors. If you use a different editor, then do a quick search on Google for "associate X text editor with Git" (replace the X with the name of your code editor).

Atom Editor Setup
git config --global core.editor "atom --wait"
Sublime Text Setup
git config --global core.editor "'C:/Program Files/Sublime Text 2/sublime_text.exe' -n -w"
VSCode Setup
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"

Helpdesk software has made it far easier for businesses to extend their service beyond normal operating hours, but finding one that’s free while still being up to par can be easier said than done.

Fortunately, we’re here with a definitive list of the best free help desk software. By the end of this article, you’ll be able to pick out the right software provider based on your needs and reap the benefits of good customer service.

Your advise on the next steps will be appreciated. 


Best regards.

a. What functions did you perform at your previous job?
b. What achievements have you made in terms of numbers, deadlines, or quality improvements? 

For example: "Sales Manager" 
development and implementation of activities to increase sales;
negotiating with key clients and concluding contracts;
development of new projects;
implementation of the CRM system;
reporting.

Achievements: 
- Brought 30 new clients in 3 months.
- Trained 5 new specialists.
- Increased sales by 40%.

Analyze the suitable vacancies of companies from your rating. Pay attention to the requirements for responding to vacancies. 
Divide the vacancies into those where you can immediately send the documents that you already have on hand (resume, portfolio), and those where you need additional documents (cover letter).
Send your resume and portfolio (if necessary) to the first list of vacancies. To the second list, write a template cover letter for each job, changing only the details related to a specific position.

Hello Ifedayo,
[In all honesty, I do not understand the necessity for this] 
This is outrightly rude. You can attempt to explain yourself without being rude either via email or via vocal conversation (on phone or in person. Please do not let this repeat itself whenever you engage your line manager.

I have read @Nugboyon Gangbe email and I do not see any insensitivity. If anything, I know he has been sensitive to your course on many occasions without your knowledge. His main point of correction was proactivity on your part and you will agree with me that this is on the back-drop of precedence, a feedback I think you should take heed to.

Hi Yassmin/Maroun,

Trust you are doing great.

Just thought to bring this up again as it as gone really cold. We would like to re-engage 
your team on our solutions assessment engagement with our customers.  

We currently have 3-4 Customers that are approaching their anniversary and we will 
need to run a SAM for them. 

The purpose and value to the customer will be to determine their current licensing position 
(Contract Optimization) and also help optimize their infrastructure in any way possible. 

While I know that I can engage them to achieve the first point using the MAP tool, 
we currently do not have anyone in house that can use this tool and I also know it is 
currently not supported by Microsoft anymore. 

Also I didn’t get the email from Yassmin to start the onboarding process and I will 
appreciate if this can be reinitiated. 

Find below a list of Customers we are currently engaging to carry out a SAM in their environment.

1.	Fidelity Bank
2.	KeyStone Bank
3.	Dangote Industries
4.	Guaranty Trust Bank.

I kindly look forward to your support on this request and I will really appreciate if this can be treated with outmost priority.

Thanks as I await you feedback on the next steps.





Dear Olatunji,

The mail below refers.

You will recall that at our last meeting, it was agreed that your team should spend a few days to validate our requirement against your ERP solution before our joint team commence work on it.  However, we are yet to hear from you more than one (1) week after Abiola sent the requirements to you.

Given the urgency of this project, we would like to know your position to enable us to determine the way forward.

Please treat as urgent.




"A documented description of the customer success practice, including:
o	Executive Sponsor, Charter & Strategy,
o	People (CSM)
o	Go-To-Market,
o	Operation – Process, Playbooks/template, Tools,
o	Optimize & Growth methodology. "





I see so many activities and requests coming in and out of CBN. It appears that Emmanuel is 
overwhelmed and doing it all alone. 

I see the same trend with Nugboyon on Access or NLNG or CHI Limited etc. 

I remember advising us to get involved even if it is not your account but I do not see that happening. 

It will be a huge tragedy if all these activities are going on and we are not learning. 

It will be a huge loss of opportunity if we do not take advantage. 

No one will have the time to sit us down and train. We can try but it will be difficult. 

Now there can only be two scenarios. 

Those with the activities are always pressed for time to deliver and meet internal and 

external customer expectations, so I can understand if they are constrained to just get the job 

done all by themselves. However, I will urge and appeal to them to please carry others along so that 

we can have shared knowledge. 


Those trainings MUST be completed before next Friday. and they form part of your SLA for the month of November.

Stephen...my expection for Huawei cloud is that you engage them completely. I am still constrained 
to be involved which is not my expectation after handing over to you and Timothy. I want to see
more impact of this engagement on demand and opportunity generation.

This goes for everyone with respect to the OEM they carry.

Essentially, any device that can function completely independently of a remote server is a thick client. Everyday examples of thick clients include desktop PCs or laptops running Windows or MacOS


A thin client is a computer system used to run applications where most of the actual processing is done on a remote server linked over a network


A thick client has its own operating system, software, processing capabilities, and local storage - all of which lets it continue working without any issues while offline.


A thin client is usually a stripped down computer with limited processing capabilities that’s been specifically optimized to run inside a network environment. It has very limited local storage and a streamlined OS. In contrast to a thick client, a thin client needs access to the remote server in order to function properly.

The primary purpose of a thin client is to act as a gateway to the network and to display information to the end user.



789139

Decreases IT cost since thin clients are cheaper
Cheaper and easier to manager - almost no apps, does not crash
Eliminates client-side hardware upgrade and refresh
Client-side devices last longer - since there are no moving parts
More secure - stipped down OS, little app footprint, better virus protection 
Reduced power consumption
Centralized Backup
Decrease TCO 



There are three ways a thin client can be used: shared services, desktop virtualization, or browser based.

With shared terminal services, all users at thin client stations share a server-based operating system and applications. Users of a shared services thin client are limited to simple tasks on their machine like creating folders, as well as running IT-approved applications.

Desktop virtualization, or UI processing, means that each desktop lives in a virtual machine, which is partitioned off from other virtual machines in the server. The operating system and applications are not shared resources, but they still physically live on a remote server. These virtualized resources can be accessed from any device that is able to connect to the server.

A browser-based approach to using thin clients means that an ordinary device connected to the internet carries out its application functions within a web browser instead of on a remote server. Data processing is done on the thin client machine, but software and data are retrieved from the network.

RBL Bank is one of India's leading private sector banks with an expanding presence across the country

over 11.77 million customers through a network of 507 branches


Challenge
India’s banking sector has seen seismic changes in the last 10 years through digital technologies, and it’s the banks that have moved fastest towards convenience banking that have seen the greatest success. RBL Bank, whose network of 392 branches and 1,221 correspondent branches across 28 Indian states, is one of those success stories. Today, it is rated India’s best bank in the mid-size bank segment. Yet, the bank’s current position as a digital leader is the result of a journey and the development of a fluid architecture that started several years ago, at a time when the IT infrastructure in place was the opposite of the business enabler it is today.


application access was frustratingly slow in turn impacting staff's ability to cross sell and upsell products.
speed of rolling out new services was affected
IT was overwhelmed with support requests

Multimedia redirection (MMR) is the process of redirecting a media file from the PCoIP host (typically a VMware View vDesktop on the server) to the end user device.

What is VMware Horizon Media redirection for Microsoft teams?

What is VMware Horizon Media redirection for Microsoft teams?
The Media Optimization for Microsoft Teams feature redirects audio calls, video calls, and viewing desktop shares for a seamless experience between the client system and the remote session without negatively affecting the virtual infrastructure and overloading the network.


VMware Horizon is a virtualization software product for delivering desktops and apps on Windows, Linux, and MacOS systems




The Horizon architecture is made up of the following components:





Components Microsoft manages
Microsoft manages the following Azure Virtual Desktop services as part of Azure:

Web Access: The Web Access service within Window Virtual Desktop lets users access virtual desktops and remote apps through an HTML5-compatible web browser as they would with a local PC, from anywhere on any device. You can secure Web Access using multifactor authentication in Azure Active Directory.
Gateway: The Remote Connection Gateway service connects remote users to Azure Virtual Desktop apps and desktops from any internet-connected device that can run an Azure Virtual Desktop client. The client connects to a gateway, which then orchestrates a connection from a VM back to the same gateway.
Connection Broker: The Connection Broker service manages user connections to virtual desktops and remote apps. The Connection Broker provides load balancing and reconnection to existing sessions.
Diagnostics: Remote Desktop Diagnostics is an event-based aggregator that marks each user or administrator action on the Azure Virtual Desktop deployment as a success or failure. Administrators can query the event aggregation to identify failing components.
Extensibility components: Azure Virtual Desktop includes several extensibility components. You can manage Azure Virtual Desktop using Windows PowerShell or with the provided REST APIs, which also enable support from third-party tools.

Azure Virtual Network: 
Azure AD: Azure Virtual Desktop uses Azure AD for identity and access management. Azure AD integration applies Azure AD security features like conditional access, multifactor authentication, and the Intelligent Security Graph, and helps maintain app compatibility in domain-joined VMs.
AD DS: Azure Virtual Desktop VMs must domain-join an AD DS service, and the AD DS must be in sync with Azure AD to associate users between the two services. You can use Azure AD Connect to associate AD DS with Azure AD.
Azure Virtual Desktop session hosts: A host pool can run the following operating systems:
Windows 7 Enterprise
Windows 10 Enterprise
Windows 10 Enterprise Multi-session
Windows Server 2012 R2 and above
Custom Windows system images with pre-loaded apps, group policies, or other customizations
You can choose VM sizes, including GPU-enabled VMs. Each session host has an Azure Virtual Desktop host agent, which registers the VM as part of the Azure Virtual Desktop workspace or tenant. Each host pool can have one or more app groups, which are collections of remote applications or desktop sessions that users can access.

Azure Virtual Desktop workspace: The Azure Virtual Desktop workspace or tenant is a management construct to manage and publish host pool resources.

Azure Virtual Desktop combines the scale, security, and cost benefits of Azure and Microsoft 365 for a secure remote desktop from virtually anywhere.

Windows 365 Enterprise is a complete software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution that streams a personalized, secure, and scalable Windows experience to any device

So I had someone take over the driving after a while and typed down a things.

All things are lawful but not all things are expedient

I will be tired by the time I get home and would like to pen down my thoughts ahead.

I am do not have rights over any of our houses but I will speak the truth as this is a burden we have
all come to share.

It does not feel right to ask mummy or even anyone who is already in any of our houses to leave 
because someone else is coming in. 

If this must happen, then this is the kind of situation where we bail each other out. Ordinarily, mummy
left my house not too long ago and this is the kind of time Laolu bails us out, so that we can
share this burden. If we had all reached a consensus and made the rotation idea work, this burden may
have become easier to bear.


We always had 3 options in front of us and each of those options had consequences.

1. Mummie rotates across all her 4 children for a period of 6 months each. This option 
was created to share the burden amongst all of us. In the space of 2 years she would only stay 
for 6 months with each person. This option would only have worked if 4 of us agreed and then
in turn sought the support of our spouses. As we have often said, making mummy stay on her own
is not a bad thing but this option demands tolerance, sacrifice, long suffering
understanding.

2. Mummie goes back to Ikorodu and we employ a live-in care. This option is pretty explanatory.
With this option, she is distant from every support she has, her children, her friends, church, 
sister, hospital etc. In short she is lonely and if we have to tell ourselves the truth, nothing 
kills faster than this. I am not saying this is what will happen but you will agree with me that
this is a possibility

3. We rent a space for Mummie as she as requested. She is requesting for this so that she is not
distant from every support she has, her children, her friends, church, 
sister, hospital etc. Even with this option, she will still be lonely. This option doesnt
make sense to me when someone of her age has her own house but then rents an apartment.


I will go with what we decide to do but in my honest opinion we missed a great opportunity to 
reach a consensus on making option 1 work. It is not too late.

Right now, the tenant is proving difficult for option 2 to work

Option 3 is expensive and the cash to execute this is not readily available

Going to Aboru is an embarassment but if this is what we decide is best, not a problem

Lastly, Osa should be carried along. She is also his mother.


to ask if there are any questions or clarifications that the team requires as they are 
reviewing our submission.



If there are areas that you’re uncomfortable with, we are available to provide demos for them. Just FYI.
 
our initial response to the RFP and do kindly let us know if you have any questions or 
require us to clarify anything contained therein.

Make these marketing materials easily accessible. 
Utilizing creativity and wit is a great way to engage 
consumers in this awareness stage. 
I recommend creating a strong social presence for said product. In the era of social media, many tools are available in the market that provide companies with the techniques and methods to increase product awareness through social channels – enabling them to reach a large number of customers at a low cost!

Product Interest

In this stage consumers are ready to learn more about your 
companies product and / or service. 
Your organization must guide the consumer through the 
interest stage by providing easily accessible information 
on your product. Among the methods used in the todays 
business landscape include a website describing the product, 
blog posts, tutorial or instructional videos, white papers, and other sources of info that the potential consumer can discover and review.

Product Evaluation

Prior to purchasing, consumers examine, compare and evaluate 
the product. Such behavior increases in intensity 
and need once the item in question is more expensive, sophisticated and complex, or critical. Consumers are searching for information. We are now finding that consumers go online and utilize social media channels to ask other individuals about your product or service. In addition, they find online reviews and recommendations. In order to simplify a customer’s search and evaluation of your product, I suggest creating information that outlines the difference between your product and other similar products, or differences within the different products and services you sell. Outline what separates your product from others, and emphasize on strength. Another great system to utilize is the webinar. This platform allow you to communicate with potential customer in depth information about your product and provides time for Q&A.

Product Trial

This is the stage where the consumer “kicks the tires”. 
Nothing helps a consumer make a decision about your 
product more than actually trying your product out! 
There are many ways this is accomplished. For example, 
your company can provide your consumer with a free trial or a proof of concept campaign. In this stage it is very important to set the customer expectations correctly and deliver on said expectations.

Product Adoption

When the consumer enters the product adoption phase, 
he/she is ready to purchase your companies product. 
This is the critical stage that businesses need to get 
their consumers to. When the customer is here, you 
need to make the payment process simple, intuitive, and pain free. In addition, you need to ensure that the consumer can easily obtain the product. If you make it to and through this last phase successfully, than you can take money to the bank - A job well done!

- Word PO 
This word PO is disappointing. The footer of the document is in another page and I cannot understand
how we were comfortable to submit such a document. This is simply not what we should be correcting
us about.

Did we need anyone to tell us that the CPS was not dated? Yet it was submitted like that?


Share the following documents, before creating another CLT

Follow the following steps in filling the manual order
•	Fill in the SKUs for year 1 from the CPS  - Please note that this SKU has been locked in the special pricing of this enrolment by CPS 1032733.005. Hence, the price is 160.08 per unit. Please update the price.

Hi @Babajide Adeyemo,
 
Shortly after logging Dangote EA Year 1 order, the customer requested,
based on their management's instructions, 
 to cut down the license quantity of Microsoft Viva with Glint add-on 
from 4,000 to 500 and then convert reduction to more productive tools like PowerBi and M365 etc. 
Attached is the email from the customer requesting for this order adjustment.
 
To complete this order adjustment, Microsoft had to revise the CPS for us to create a ticket and the 
processing team made some recommendations on that ticket.Attached is the previous ticket that was raised.

Now to finalize the order adjustment, we are required to sign the attached revised CPS and resend 
to the processing team.

Please find attached the revised CPS for your approval.

We thank you once again for the opportunity to be of service to the bank. It is a privilege that we 
don’t take for granted.
 
As you are aware, we are expected to pay Microsoft upfront for the licenses, but in the 
spirit of the new partnership that we are entering into with the bank, we would be 
willing to extend a credit period of 21days to the bank to make payment for the licenses. 
If, however, the bank fails to pay within this 21days period, then a 2% default charge per 
month would kick in to the expected payment amount.
 
Once again, thank you for your patronage. We look forward to a successful project with the bank.

Today's experience with your CC agents has been extremely frustrating. From one agent refusing to understand that her background noise was extremely distracting despite being told repeatedly, to another who kept asking questions to another who would not speak louder, to another who se advise did not solve my problem among a few others.  This is extremely disappointing for such an organization. Please I do not wish to be contacted via telephone but only via email. Thanks. 


extremely frustrating slow speed . almost unuseable despite being on unlimited plan. forced to find alternatives

Good morning sirs

I hope we have all had a great week so far

Please this is an appeal for those yet to contribute the energy bills (for the pumping machine) for 
January and February.

In addition, I propose we immediately (today) move the pumping machine back to a direct connection so 
that we do not have to continue this contribution until a time when we decide to reconnect to 
another meter.

Dear Team,
Good morning and Trust we are doing well.

This is to officially announce our newly designed Ticketing System/Dashoard.

For now, the Dashboard will be used to track and manage Tasks assigned to members of the Tech Team. 
Later it can be extended to other departments.

How can Task be assigned?
To assign a Task to any member of the Tech team, follow the instructions below

- send an email to the individual (using the @symbol approach) and copy msteam@tasksystems.com 
(see sample email)

Recall that some months ago, we were looking for solutions that could automate assigning of tasks in form of " Ticket" to members of team. To resolve this challenge, I was able to develop this solution called “Ticketing System” using Power Automate and SharePoint.In brief, using this solution, Task can be assigned automatically to anyone by forwarding the message from Office 365 Outlook capturing that individual email in to “TO” field and Microsoft Practice Group in “CC” field. The assignee will receive a Teams prompt to work on the Task.Finally, kindly do well to ensure you integrate this solution to your environment. For further clarification revert to the Video shared on the “Top Talent” teams’ group.

Dear Support,
We would like to disconnect this customer - Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG)
based on the below reasons

After the EA was created on 1st April 2022 and the invoice fell due, ECG defaulted
on paying. It took several emails, follow-ups before ECG paid 50% of their EA bill
in December 2022, and then promised to pay the balance 50% in December 2022.

Unfortunately, the promised balance 50% has not been paid till date and every attempt
to reach ECG via multiple emails, phone calls, Whatsapp and Teams meeting has proved
abortive. ECG has been evasive and unresponsive with no commitment and intent to
pay the balance 50% of the Year 1 EA bill.

At all attempts to pursue our payment with the Direct of Technology, we get redirected to
the Director of Finance who never responded or acknowledged our request. Besides, the 
outstanding EA bills, ECG has also accumulated over $80k in Azure overage bills which is 
also still unpaid.

As it stands, the EA agreement is due for renewal in April 2023 and we fear that ECG's 
debt will become too burdensome for us to bear if left to keep running.

We therefore request that their service be disconnected.

Thank you.

In order to enhance the sales approval process we will be migrating from the decentralized 
sales workflow approach to a centralized system. This aproach will help to make support and 
troubleshooting easier because instead of fixing the workflow from 5 people's profile it 
will now be done from a single profile.

While we would like to begin testing this new workflow from Monday 20th March 2023, we request 
a training session with the sales, audit and finance teams on Friday 17th March, 2023.


As part of the Technology Team effort to enhance internal processes and to adopt 
a seamless approach in providing support and troubleshooting services on our internal processes, 
it is our pleasure to inform you that we will be migrating from the decentralized sales workflow 
approach to a centralized system. Therefore, before the official launching on Monday 20th
 March 2023, we will be having a Microsoft training session on Friday 17th March, 2023 with the 
sales, audit and finance team on how to use the portal.

how to create EA azure billing profile

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/mca-setup-account


Access the Microsoft Azure portal: To create an EA enrollment billing profile for a client, you need to have access to the Microsoft Azure portal. If you don't have access, you will need to request it from the client's Azure administrator.

 

Navigate to the EA enrollment page: Once you have access to the Azure portal, navigate to the EA enrollment page. You can find this page by searching for "Enterprise enrollment" in the search bar at the top of the portal.

 

Select the client's enrollment: If the client has already enrolled in an EA, you should see their enrollment listed on the EA enrollment page. Select the client's enrollment to begin creating their billing profile.

 

Create a new billing profile: On the enrollment details page, click on the "Billing profiles" tab, then click "Add profile" to create a new billing profile for the client.

 

Enter billing profile details: In the "Add billing profile" form, enter the client's billing details, including billing address, payment method, and tax registration information. Make sure to enter all information accurately and completely.

 

Review and submit: Once you have entered all the necessary details, review the billing profile information to ensure everything is correct. If everything looks good, click "Submit" to create the billing profile.

 

Notify the client: After creating the billing profile, notify the client that it has been created and provide them with the relevant billing information, including any billing IDs or account numbers they may need to reference.




To create an EA Azure billing profile, you will need to follow these steps:

Log in to the Azure portal with your EA (Enterprise Agreement) credentials.

In the left-hand menu, click on "Cost Management + Billing".

Under "Cost Management + Billing", click on "Billing profiles".

Click on the "Add" button to create a new billing profile.

Enter a name for your billing profile.

Choose your enrollment type as "Enterprise Agreement".

Enter your enrollment number and your access key, which can be found in the Azure Enterprise Portal.

Choose your currency and your billing cycle.

Review the summary of your billing profile and click "Create" to complete the process.

After following these steps, you should have successfully created an EA Azure billing profile, and you can start managing your Azure costs using the billing and cost management tools provided by Azure.



Normally an EA customer with Azure prepayment automatically gets an Azure account created and an invitation email (samp

We expected to be able to create a billing profile for NCX in order to create their Azure EA account but 
for some reason we cannot from our view.

A support ticket was raised with the hope that it would be resolved quickly but it has lingered.

Please can we get some help to get this escalated internally?

Dear Weeks,

VIOP and IP Phones are already installed and connected to Call Manager located in our Head Office in Accra, Ghana. The VIOP system is inoperation. However, as soon as you supply the equipment, MTN Nigeria will work together with your team to integrate their E1 and VIoP phones. This Yeaster has been delaying the completion of the MTN Nigeria E1 deployment in our office at Ikeja. 

We would be glad if you would deliver it as soon as possible.



The below exams are required to renew our Premier Integrator status and continue receiving the benefits, register opportunities as well as participate in bids. Attached is the latest notification from the OEM in this regard.

We intend to write the exams before the end of the week, to give us ample time to ensure that we renew our status well ahead of the 7th June 2023 deadline

It is with a heavy heart I write to give my (four) weeks’ notice of my intention to leave my position as Assistant Manager Presales. Therefore 31-01-2022 will be my last day of employment with Task Systems. I am willing to provide Training and Onboarding assistance to my successor, in order to allow for a smooth transition of all relevant parties.
I have thoroughly enjoyed my Tenure here at Task Systems, and my decision to resign was a difficult choice and after careful consideration, I have decided to realize my professional and personal goals by accepting a formal offer to study for a Post Graduate degree in Conestoga College which I believe is an exciting step forward.
As a Presales Engineer, I have seen tremendous growth and spirit amongst the team and I am confident that they will continue to flourish even after my resignation. Please be assured that any outstanding projects and business will be completed before my departure.
Should you have a need to contact me for any direction, clarification, request for information, advice etc., please feel free to reach out to me.
In conclusion, I will like to sincerely thank you for the opportunity given to me to serve, learn and grow, I therefore wish the company well in all endeavors.
